What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

When I first began working on this, I was overwhelmed with the idea of starting, because I have
never worked with OOP. My initial instinct was to start throwing code at the project, which quickly resulted in me getting overwhelmed and things breaking left and right. However, after breaking down the assignment by carefully reading through all of the files and going back to watch the A2 Overview Video on Moodle, I was able to find my footing and figure out where to start with this assignment. I would highly suggest someone taking this course in the future to carefully read through everything (even if it "doesn't seem important") and to go to office hours! Especially if you're confused on where to start, just familiarizing yourself with the files you're going to be working across is extremely useful.
